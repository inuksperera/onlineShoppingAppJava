# Shopping Application

## A shopping application developed using Java and Java Swing

This project was developed to understand the concepts of Object Oriented Programmming (OOP) in Java, as well as to 
understand how Java Swing works. The program consists of two components, a CLI for a shop manager and a GUI for a
customer. The manager has the ability to manage a list of available Products which could be either Electronic Products 
or Clothing Products. 

The manager is able to,
* add a new product to the products list
* delete a product from the products list
* print the list of products
* save the list of products to a text file
* read the list of products saved in a text file to the program
* open the GUI for the customer
* exit the menu

In the customer GUI, the customer is shown the list of products available in a scrollable list. The list can be filtered
to show both Electronic and Clothing products, or to just show either Electronic or Clothing products only. A customer can
select a product from the list and hit the "Add to shopping cart" button to add the product to the cart. The customer can 
also click on the "Shopping Cart" button to view their shopping cart and total.
